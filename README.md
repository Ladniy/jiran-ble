# Jiran BLE

Wireless version of my keyboard, based on [Holyiot-18010 (nRF52840)](http://www.holyiot.com/tp/2019042516322180424.pdf) module.

The main goal of this project is a fast and cheap production of a wireless ergonomic keyboard, mostly without soldering.

## Project Status

**Working on PCB design**

Unfortunately, at the moment JLC does not have all the necessary components in basic inventory, so you need to pay an additional 3$ for each component from the extended inventory.

For this reason, Jiran BLE may not be a really cheap solution for everyone. (I hope in the future JLC will expand their basic components catalog.)
